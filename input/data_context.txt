About Dataset
Climate change has a profound impact on global agriculture, affecting crop yields, soil health, and farming sustainability. This synthetic dataset is designed to simulate real-world agricultural data, enabling researchers, data scientists, and policymakers to explore how climate variations influence food production across different regions.

🔍 Key Features:
✔️ Climate Variables – Simulated data on temperature changes, precipitation levels, and extreme weather events
✔️ Crop Productivity – Modeled impact of climate shifts on yields of key crops like wheat, rice, and corn
✔️ Regional Insights – Includes various geographic regions to analyze diverse climate-agriculture interactions
✔️ Ideal for Predictive Modeling – Supports climate risk assessment, food security studies, and sustainability research

📊 Dataset Overview:
This dataset has been synthetically generated and does not contain real-world agricultural records. It is intended for academic learning, climate impact analysis, and machine learning applications in environmental studies.

📖 Columns Description:
Region – Simulated geographic region
Year – Modeled year of data collection
Average_Temperature – Simulated temperature levels (°C)
Precipitation – Modeled annual rainfall (mm)
Crop_Yield – Synthetic yield data for selected crops (tons/hectare)
Extreme_Weather_Events – Number of modeled extreme weather occurrences per year
⚠️ Disclaimer:
This dataset is completely synthetic and should not be used for real-world climate policy decisions or agricultural forecasting. It is meant for educational purposes, research, and data science applications.

🔹 Use this dataset to analyze climate trends, build predictive models, and explore solutions for sustainable agriculture! 🌱📊
